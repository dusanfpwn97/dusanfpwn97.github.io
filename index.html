                <h3>Crowned in Steel – Lead Developer</h3>
                <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679830/Crowned_In_Steel/">Crowned In Steel</a> is an action game set in a medieval world, and it’s me and my brother's passion project.
                I am mainly tasked with gameplay programming, but I fill all kinds of shoes as a typical indie dev. Despite working with a small budget, our goal was to prove that we could create an unforgettable and innovative experience, offering a fresh perspective within a genre often dominated by AAA productions. This project reflects my dedication to crafting engaging gameplay and memorable experiences.</p>

                <h3>Ginst – Lead Developer</h3>
                <p>I was the lead developer on <a href="https://www.g2ames.com/ginst/">Ginst</a>, a rhythm-based music game that turns your mobile device into a playable instrument. I worked on core gameplay mechanics, note synchronization, and multiplayer functionality, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience. The game features multiple modes, from arcade challenges to free play with custom MIDI tracks. I also collaborated with designers and audio engineers to fine-tune the feel of the game. It’s been awesome seeing players enjoy and interact with music in a unique way!.</p>
